# [Future Hero](https://caleb-boyle.itch.io/future-hero)
_Future Hero_ is a first-person single-player puzzle exploration game where you play as someone who has the power to see into the future. 
Your goal is to use your ability to identify disasters that have already occurred in the future, acting on them in the present to save potential victims. 
Beware, there are multiple endings you can cause, some of which may result in outcomes more or less desirable.
