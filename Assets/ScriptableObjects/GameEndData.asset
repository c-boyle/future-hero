    <Headline>k__BackingField: Local Restaurant Burns to the Ground
    <Summary>k__BackingField: "At 12:12, locals\u2019 favourite restaurant, Future
      Gyros, tragically burned to the ground! Firefighters confirmed that the source
      of the fire didn\u2019t come from the kitchen, as is usually the case with
      restaurant fires, and remains unknown for now. A disgruntled witness says \u201CThis
      was deserved! There was someone smoking indoors prior to the flame and no one
      stopped them. Smoke was going to hurt the people in there, one way or another!\u201D"
