    <Summary>k__BackingField: "At XX:XX, locals\u2019 favourite restaurant, Future
      Gyros, tragically burned to the ground! Firefighters confirmed that the source
      of the fire didn\u2019t come from the kitchen, as is usually the case with
      restaurant fires, and remains unknown for now. A disgruntled witness says \u201CThis
      was deserved! There was someone smoking indoors prior to the flame and no one
      stopped them. Smoke was going to hurt the people in there, one way or another!\u201D"

      Restaurant Committee, Aldil Adee, slipped on an unattended puddle and was rushed
      to the nearest hospital, with many witnesses believing that she died. The committee
      was very disheartened with this news, and decided to shut down Future Gyros

    <Summary>k__BackingField: "At XX:XX, beloved restaurant, Future Gyros, burned
      to the ground. Witnesses that escaped the blaze claimed that a group of ruffians
      seemed to be amped up by the fire and chose to stay inside and dance, while
      also trapping a still unidentified woman inside the restaurant. Reports indicate
      that the ruffians were heard shouting \u201Cthis is the greatest mosh I\u2019ve

    <Summary>k__BackingField: 'We are sad to report that at XX:XX today, an unidentified
      woman was lost to a blaze that brought down local favorite restaurant, Future
      Gyros. Witnesses have indicated that the woman would have likely been able
      to escape like everyone else had they not slipped on a puddle near their seat.
      Some witnesses even claim to have seen that the puddle was intentionally created
      when someone knocked her cup on the ground. '

    <Headline>k__BackingField: Unprecedented Chaos Has Struck Local Restaurant
    <Summary>k__BackingField: Today at XX:XX, local restaurant Future Gyros burned
      to the ground, with bizarre and unfortunate spectacles taking place inside.
      Witnesses that escaped the fire said that they initially assumed everyone had
      made it out of the building, but upon looking back inside saw a group of punks
      dancing despite the encroaching flames. And what may be even more bizarre,
      is that they were dancing around an unidentified woman that fell in a puddle.

    <Summary>k__BackingField: "Today at XX:XX we received reports that local restaurant
      Future Gyros was\u2026 doing fine? Apparently many things could have gone wrong.
      Witnesses report someone smoking indoors, and we all know how flammable restaurants
      are! Other witnesses talk about a group of dangerous ruffians that just decided
      to leave before causing trouble. Plus there were no slips reported today either,
      a Future Gyros\u2019 first! Clearly Future Gyros has a guardian angel looking
      over it."
